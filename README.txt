Created an animation web page.  Using images created where you would see two folders, one activated on page load.  When you come to the page a paper slides up with related information.  It allows you to click the second tab, when clicked it will slide down the paper, have the folder you cliked on come forward, and the paper come up with related informtaion.  Also created it where you run through one animation function instead of two by grabbing a number, and then for a second variable testing which one it is.
